* In weeks 2 and 3 I learned multiple new commands including `ssh`, `mkdir`, and `scp`. The `ssh` command is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote server or system. The `mkdir` command is a command used to create a new directory. The `scp` command copies files or directories between a local and a remote system, or between two remote systems. I also learned how to locally connect to a remote server.
